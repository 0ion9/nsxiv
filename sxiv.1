.SH DESCRIPTION
sxiv is a simple image viewer for X. It only has the most basic features
required for fast image viewing.
.P
sxiv opens all named
.IR FILE s,
or reads the names of the files to open from standard input, if only a single
hyphen\-minus
.RB ( \- )
is given.
.P
sxiv has two modes of operation: image and thumbnail mode. The default is image
mode, in which only the current image is shown. In thumbnail mode a grid of 
small previews is displayed, making it easy to choose an image to open.
.P
sxiv can also cache its thumbnails. Please see the section THUMBNAIL CACHING
for information on how to enable this feature.

Please note, that the fullscreen mode requires an EWMH/NetWM compliant window

.SH THUMBNAIL CACHING
To enable thumbnail caching, please make sure to create the directory
.I ~/.sxiv/
with write permissions. sxiv will then store all thumbnails inside this
directory, but it will not create this directory by itself. It rather uses the
existance of this directory as an affirmation, that the user wants thumbnails
to be cached.
.P
Use the command line option
.I \-c
to keep the cache directory clean by removing all orphaned cache files.
Additionally, run the following command afterwards inside the cache directory
to remove empty subdirectories:
.P
.RS
find -type d -empty -delete
