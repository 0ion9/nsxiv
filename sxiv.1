.SH DESCRIPTION
sxiv is a simple image viewer for X. It only has the most basic features
required for fast image viewing.
.P
sxiv opens all named
.IR FILE s,
or reads the names of the files to open from standard input, if only a single
hyphen\-minus
.RB ( \- )
is given.
.P
sxiv has two modes of operation: image and thumbnail mode. The default is image
mode, in which only the current image is shown. In thumbnail mode a grid of 
small previews is displayed, making it easy to choose an image to open.
.P
Please note, that the fullscreen mode requires an EWMH/NetWM compliant window
manager.
